				<h1>What is Access Barnard?</h1>
					<p style= "font-size: 25px">Access Barnard serves as the hub of College efforts to enhance the academic experiences, and promote the inclusion and excellence of first-generation, low-income, and international students in their transition to and persistence through the Barnard experience. We do so by celebrating identities, cultivating community, empowering exploration, mentoring others, and building allyship, holistic development, and self-advocacy. Located in Milbank Hall at the north end of campus, Access Barnard is home to FLI (first-generation/low-income) Initiatives, International Student Services (ISS), and Opportunity Programs (OP).</p>

						<h4>First-Generation/Low-Income Student Initiatives (FLI) provides specialized advising and support to all students who identify with the first-generation and/or low-income college experience. Access Barnard seeks to empower and enrich the experience of FLI students both inside and outside of the classroom as they navigate Barnard. </h4>
					<h3>International Student Services (ISS)</h3>
						<!-- hyperlink iss website -->
						<h4>International Student Services (ISS) serves the needs of F-1, J-1 visa students, and self-identified international students at the College. ISS provides a wide array of services to new, continuing and visiting international students. The office also develops year-round academic, cultural, and social programming, oversees the Global Ambassadors, and serves as a global resource for the larger Barnard community.</h4>
					<h3>Peer Mentoring Program</h3>
						<h4>Peer mentoring is widely considered a high-impact practice for student success. Peer mentoring has been shown to enhance students' sense of belonging and satisfaction with their college experience and enhance psycho-social belonging. For students new to the college experience, peer mentors have been shown to be indispensable to the transition, particularly for first-generation students. Access Barnard Peer Mentors help students identify their needs and connect them to institutional resources.</h4>
