		<h2> About Me </h2>
			<p> Hi - I'm currently a freshman at Barnard College aspiring to study Computer Science and Economics. As my parents opened multiple restuarants during my childhood, I have always been surrounded by entrepreneurship which ultimately led to my interest in sneaker reselling. I hope to one day create a website that enables sellers to sell their products with a zero percent selling fee. </p>
		<h2> Interests </h2>
			<p> In my free time, I enjoy sourcing sneakers that may have potential value. To know the market value of my inventory, I use websites such as Stock X and Goat to get a better picture: <a href="https://stockx.com">StockX</a>/<a href="https://www.goat.com">Goat</a>
