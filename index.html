		<h1> Maggie Zhu </h1>
			<p> Hi - I'm currently a freshman at Barnard College aspiring to study Computer Science and Economics. As my parents opened multiple restuarants during my childhood, I have always been surrounded by entrepreneurship which ultimately led to my interest in sneaker reselling. I hope to one day create a website that enables sellers to sell their products with a zero percent selling fee. </p>
