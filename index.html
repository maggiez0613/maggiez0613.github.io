		Hi - I'm currently a freshman at Barnard College aspiring to study Computer Science and Economics. As my parents opened multiple restuarants throughout the United States, I have always been surrounded by entrepreneurship which ultimately led to my interest in sneaker reselling. I hope to one day create a website that enables sellers to sell their products with no additional fees taken from them.
