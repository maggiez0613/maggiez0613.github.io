			<h2> About Me </h2>
				<p> Hi - I'm currently a freshman at Barnard College aspiring to study Computer Science and Economics. During my childhood, my parents opened multiple restuarants which sparked my interest in entrepreneurship and one day owning my own business. Lately, I have been setting up the logistics of a potential idea.
			<h2> Interests </h2>
				<p> In my free time, I enjoy sourcing sneakers that may have potential value. To know the market value of my inventory, I use websites such as Stock X and Goat to get a better picture: <a href="https://stockx.com">StockX</a>/<a href="https://www.goat.com">Goat.</a> I hope to one day create a website that enables sellers to sell their products with a zero percent selling fee. </p>
